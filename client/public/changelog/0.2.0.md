^thx for helping a bit [QmelZ](https://github.com/QmelZ/)
  - Settings are now divided into three* tabs:
    - **General** - change language, UI scale, chat box proportions, and other stuff
    - **Input** - tweak keybinds
    - **Audio** - tweak volumes and toggle sounds
    - \***Debug** exists but you probably don't need it
- revamped Credits page
- Changelog page to view changelogs of updates
- <kbd>O</kbd> and <kbd>P</kbd> for toggling UI has been combined into one key <kbd>F1</kbd><br>
^thx [hyxud](https://github.com/hyxud)
- very wacky and broken mobile controls initial implementation
  - you can move and look around, but no building
- highlight cubes (<kbd>v</kbd>)
    - atm this is useless, but it's for an upcoming thing
- iocaptcha is no more :(
- non-functional grid toggle button in toolbar
- likely missed some stuff to put here

that's it for now. have fun!
