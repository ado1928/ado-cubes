# 0.2.0 - a very big update!
????????????????, 2023
<hr>
<strong>NOTE</strong>: this changelog is a draft. expect changes!<br>
<br>
after 9 months of messily and mostly inactive on-and-off development, the adocubes trinty presents you a new update!<br>
<br>
i hope you don't mind the "improved" main world, mac was too dumb to ask ifrit to make a script that converts old worlds to new format
(also, the more latest world was likely wiped when hetzner took down server)

## changelog
- UI overhaul! please give feedback
  - updated logo as well
- improved palette
  - added new and tweaked existing colors (31 to 50)
  - 5 colors per row layout
  - hold <kbd>Left Alt</kbd> or <kbd>Z</kbd> to scroll vertically
    - <kbd>Z</kbd> exists for Firefox because <kbd>Left Alt</kbd> doesn't work
- multiple worlds (currently buggy, but does work)
- sounds (buttons, palette, and cube placing & breaking)
- use your mouse to place and break cubes<br>

	- they can also be inline links, like [this](https://ado1928.github.io)<br>
	\[this\](https://ado1928.github.io)
  - colors :#6:⬛:#20:⬛:#31:⬛:#:
    - check /formatting for details
- replaced Controls page in favor of Settings
- revamped Settings page (very wip)<br>
^thx for helping a bit [QmelZ](https://github.com/QmelZ/)
  - Settings are now divided into three sections:
    - **General** - change language, UI scale, chat box proportions, and other stuff
    - **Input** - tweak keybinds
    - **Audio** - tweak volumes and toggle sounds
- revamped Credits page
- Changelog page to view changelogs of updates
- <kbd>O</kbd> and <kbd>P</kbd> for toggling UI has been combined into one key <kbd>F1</kbd><br>
^thx [hyxud](https://github.com/hyxud)
- highlight cubes (<kbd>v</kbd>)
    - atm this is useless, but it's for an upcoming thing
- iocaptcha is no more :(
- grid toggle button in toolbar
- additional security checks in server to prevent *most* ways of crashing server
  - simple implementation of ratelimit for cube placing & breaking and chat<br>
  (24 cubes per second, 8 messages sent per second)
- more messy code

likely missed some stuff, but they're likely very minor that it doesn't matter too much<br>
<br>
anyways that's it for now. have fun!
