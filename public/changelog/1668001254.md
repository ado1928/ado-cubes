adocubes 0.2.0

## Changes
### Added
- Multiple worlds. Currently buggy, but does work
- Sounds for interacting with buttons, scrolling the palette, and placing and removing cubes
- Camera zoom (<kbd>+</kbd> to increase, <kbd>-</kbd> to decrease, <kbd>'</kbd> to reset)
- Color picker (Use middle mouse button)
- Iffy chat commands

### Removed
- Controls page in favor of Settings

### Changed
- Revamped the UI. please give feedback
- Revamped Settings page. Still a work in progress
  - Settings are now divided into four tabs:
    - **General** - Change language, UI scale, chat box proportions, and other miscellaneous stuff
    - **Input** - Tweak keybinds for camera speed, zoom, grid toggle, settings shortcut, and cube placing and removing
    - **Audio** - Tweak volumes, and toggle sounds
    - **Gameplay** - I have no idea what this will be for other than for toggling clouds (which still hasn't been implemented yet). It'll likely be replaced/merged with a new tab
    - Additionally, there's also **Debug**.
- Improved palette a bit
  - Added and tweaked colors (31 to 50)
  - 5 colors per row
  - Hold <kbd>Alt</kbd> to scroll vertically
